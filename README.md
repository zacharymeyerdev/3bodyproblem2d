# 3bodyproblem2d
I want to experiment with animation and physics, and as I recently read a novel concerning this, I am interested in the subject at the moment.

Before I start anything, I want to make a list of what I want to do, so feature-creep doesn't sink in.

I want to model the 3 body problem on a 2d plane.
I want this constant movement to be animated at 30, 45, or at most 60 frames per second.
I want the calculations to be as accurate as possible.

This Wikipedia model of it (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem) is really cool, so I want to do something like that, but make the lines between the bodies toggleable.

I need to decide whether to make all of the bodies the same, or different weights.
I need to decide the initial positions, directions, and velocities from the center of mass.

Imports I would like:
matplotlib - for .animation and .pyplot.
numpy - for its various mathematical features.

I still need to learn the use cases for these libraries, so this project will mostly be about teaching myself about those.
